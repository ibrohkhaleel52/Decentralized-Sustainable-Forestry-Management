# Decentralized Sustainable Forestry Management

A blockchain-based system for transparent, verifiable, and sustainable forestry management.

## Overview

This decentralized application (dApp) enables forest owners, regulatory bodies, certification agencies, and consumers to participate in a transparent ecosystem for sustainable forestry management. By leveraging blockchain technology, we create immutable records of forest boundaries, harvest plans, replanting efforts, and sustainability certifications.

## Core Smart Contracts

### Forest Parcel Registration Contract

Records and verifies the boundaries and ownership of managed woodland parcels.

**Key Features:**
- Geospatial boundary registration using GPS coordinates
- Proof of ownership verification
- Historical ownership records
- Integration with existing land registries
- Support for fractional ownership

### Harvest Planning Contract

Manages sustainable cutting schedules to ensure forest resources are not depleted.

**Key Features:**
- Tree inventory and species composition tracking
- Growth rate modeling
- Sustainable yield calculations
- Harvest scheduling with environmental considerations
- Carbon sequestration estimation

### Replanting Verification Contract

Tracks and verifies reforestation efforts to ensure harvested areas are properly restored.

**Key Features:**
- Seedling type and quantity records
- Planting date and location verification
- Growth monitoring checkpoints
- Survival rate tracking
- Climate adaptation metrics

### Certification Contract

Validates compliance with sustainability standards and issues verifiable certificates.

**Key Features:**
- Integration with major forestry certification standards (FSC, PEFC, etc.)
- Audit trail for inspection records
- Compliance scoring metrics
- Certificate issuance and revocation logic
- Public verification interface

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum/Polygon for smart contracts
- **Storage**: IPFS for storing larger datasets (images, detailed documents)
- **Oracle Integration**: Chainlink for external data verification
- **Frontend**: React.js web application
- **Geospatial**: Integration with OpenStreetMap and satellite imagery APIs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Truffle or Hardhat for smart contract development
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Basic understanding of blockchain concepts

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-forestry.git
cd decentralized-forestry

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile smart contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to local test network
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
2. Set up your blockchain provider endpoints
3. Configure geospatial API keys
4. Set verification thresholds for certification

## Use Cases

### For Forest Owners

- Register forest parcels with verifiable boundaries
- Create and submit sustainable harvest plans
- Document replanting efforts with proof
- Obtain and maintain sustainability certifications
- Access premium markets for certified forest products

### For Regulators

- Monitor forest management practices in real-time
- Verify compliance with local regulations
- Access transparent harvest and replanting records
- Reduce inspection costs through automated verification

### For Certification Bodies

- Streamline certification processes
- Maintain tamper-proof audit trails
- Issue verifiable digital certificates
- Monitor ongoing compliance

### For Consumers and Supply Chain

- Verify the sustainability of wood products
- Track the origin of forest products
- Support responsible forest management
- Make informed purchasing decisions

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1**: Core smart contract development and testing
- **Phase 2**: Web application development and oracle integration
- **Phase 3**: Mobile app for field verification and data collection
- **Phase 4**: Integration with existing certification bodies
- **Phase 5**: Carbon credit marketplace extension
